#Creating Gower matrix distance for binary variables. This is from package Vegan.
#this can aslo be created using daisy() in cluster package and from gower.dist() in StatMatch package.
#Gower distance can also be used for mixed type variables when clustering.When Calculated for only continuous
#it results in metric as close as what we get from euclidean distance.
